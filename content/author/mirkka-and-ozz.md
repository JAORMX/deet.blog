As some of you probably know, we're a Finnish-Mexican couple who met through our love of heavy metal and weirdness. As time passed, we started to grow a love for plants and figured out we both like dogs!

With the stray dog situation as it is in many countries, we thought that the ethical thing to do would be to get a rescue dog. So we contacted Kulkurit, and with their help and following their process is how we added our newest furry member to te family: Deet!
