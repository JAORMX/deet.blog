As some of you probably know, we're a Finnish-Mexican couple who met through our love of heavy metal and weirdness. We both have always wanted to have a dog but the time wasn't right yet. Now when it finally was, we were more than excited to start to adopt a dog.

With the stray dog situation as it is in many countries, we thought that the ethical thing to do would be to get a rescue dog. So we contacted [Kulkurit](https://kulkurit.fi/), and with their help and following their process is how we added our newest furry member to the family: Deet!

This blog is basically for us in order to create fun memories but also to follow Deet's progress to settle down. Also, it would be great if someone who is planning to have a rescue dog would get something out of this. Anyway, it's good to remember that this a story of one specific dog and all of them have their own story behind. This will affect how much time and space they need to get to use to the new family and the new environment.
