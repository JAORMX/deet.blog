In the evening we decided to get some fresh air outside. We hoped it could help Deet's schedule which is very upside down at the moment. It turned out great! We finally saw Deet choosing our company instead of being by herself, and were even able to have a small training session with her.

Milestones:

* Deet approached us in the park!
* It was the first time Deet got interested in toys.
* It was also the first time we had a small training session.
* Deet started walking on her leash (not only laying by a bush).
* Deet hanged out with us in the living room (and even took a nap there).

Deet still has a teenager schedule, sleeping in the days and staying awake at night :D. So, in the morning, you can notice she's had an interesting adventure at night.

Given her activities at night, it was a little hard to convince her to go out of her safe place in the day. Around 5pm, our teenager finally started waking up! So we thought it would be a good idea to bring her out to get some fresh air! Still, it's not going as smooth as we would hope. But we're getting there.
