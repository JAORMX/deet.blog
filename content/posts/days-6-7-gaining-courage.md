# Gaining courage

During these two days, Deet has shown remarkable progress.

Milestones

* She was looking around the house by herself during the day (not only because of the treats)
* She didn't go fast back to her crate - she was smelling and exploring around in peace
* During the 6th day, she went by herself to the balcony which was a totally new place for her
* She got interested in the rain, smells and sounds that came from the balcony
* She came close smelling (even the face!) and looked playful
* First sounds (?), she was whining a little because of the excitement

***

Challenge has been that Deet has always come out of the creat only with treats and then ran quickly back to her safe spot. 

Her 5th and 6th days were different. On the 5th she came out after the treats but she was more calm and confident. She stayed longer time, looked around, and sniffed things around her. Also, she felt more confident to walk to other rooms even if there were no treats around. When you have as shy rescue dog as Deet has been so far, this little steps feel like milestones!!

In the evening after so amazing day, we had some popsicle made of chicken broth.

Deet's 6th day at the new home was an even bigger success! Deet heard the raindrops dropping to the balcony window and I think it was the first time she realized we have a balcony. That triggered her curiosity - all the interesting sounds and smells from outside! She started to walk around and went even to the balcony by herself even if the place was totally new to her. 

Seemed she started to get used to me as well because she started to approach me differently. More excited, much happier, and much more confident.
