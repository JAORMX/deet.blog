During these months we consumed Zak George’s books and youtube videos about dog training and watched webinars the Koiruuksien Klubi offered. Highly recommending all those resources for people who are planning to have a dog!

Adoption process, pandemics… connect people!

The Covid-19 was slowing down the adoption process because the countries shut down and closed their borders. Sometimes waiting felt endless but the Kulkurit association had a great idea: Let’s share the waiting process and build a Facebook group for people in the same situation.

And so it happened and in the end we had an awesome support group around. People shared not only tips and questions related to the arriving dogs but also all the excitement, happiness and frustration that the waiting during the pandemics brought up. In the end we also created a whatsapp group which became one of the best things during the whole waiting process and after having the dog home. Can’t wait to see these amazing people and their dogs at some point!
