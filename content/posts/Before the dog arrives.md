## Waiting for Deet

{{< figure src="/images/whatsapp-image-2020-07-09-at-12-16-15.jpeg" >}}

The adoption process was everything else than a normal case. The Covid-19 was slowing down dog delivery because the countries shut down and closed their borders, and nobody knew when things would get better, and the dogs would be able to travel to Finland.

During these months, we consumed [Zak George](https://www.dogtrainingrevolution.com "Zak George")’s books and youtube videos about dog training and watched webinars the [Koiruuksien Klubi ](https://www.koiruuksienklubi.fi/)offered. We highly recommend all those resources for people who are planning to have a dog!

For a long time, we spent time browsing Facebook and Kulkurit's website, looking for videos of the dogs, and trying to spot our Deet even for a second or two. That was probably one of the hardest things while waiting since we didn't know how our dog was doing along this time, even if we knew that they were well taken care of. We did understand, however, that they cannot give updates to everybody on their dogs all the time, they sure were many on the waiting list!

The time before the dogs arrived was also great for shopping and getting crazy in the pet shop!

One other thing we did while waiting is spending some time looking at the different dog food options. And damn! There are so many options! It was hard to decide on which food to buy, given that there are so many variations in price and quality. However, we believe that we ended up finding a good compromise with [Canagan](https://www.canagan.co.uk "Canagan"). Yet, we're still interested in a local brand called [Alvar](https://alvarpet.com/en/ "Alvar"). We'll keep you updated on this!

### The adoption process & pandemic: connecting people!

Sometimes waiting felt endless, but the Kulkurit association had a great idea: Let’s share the waiting process and build a Facebook group for people in the same situation.

And so it happened, and in the end, we had a great support group around. People shared not only tips and questions related to the arriving dogs but also all the excitement, happiness, and frustration that the waiting during the pandemics brought up. In the end, we also created a WhatsApp group, which became one of the best things during the whole waiting process and after having the dog home. We can’t wait to see these amazing people and their dogs at some point!
