We are trying to change Deet's schedule, but it hasn't been the easiest thing to do. When she sleeps, she sleeps. Anyhow, today we got some little progress with that, and in the evening we had a great time in the park!

Milestones today

* Deet was awake around 11 am and she came to hang out with us.
* Deet was having a great time in the park.
* She approaches us when we were outdoors!
* She follows the "come here" command every now and then - a great start!
* Deet is very calm when she sees other dogs, humans, birds etc. at the park.
* She walked much better in the leash.
* First poop outside!!!!
* We brushed her and she really enjoyed it :)

Deet's schedule has been a little problematic so far, and our next big goal is to try to change it. We talked with our contact person from Kulkurit and created a plan: we try different treats and try to find her top 1 (chicken works, but not in every case) and then try to get her out little earlier every day.

This morning she seemed to be more awake than before. We were able to get her out from the crate by introducing meatballs to her. But after a little while she went back to the crate. It's ok, it was a good start and in the end we all took a nap :D

Other than that, the evening went like usually: Deet wakes up in the evening and it always takes time to get her out of the create so that we would be able to go out. This time it also took more time because we changed the harness.

We were able to go out 7:30 pm. Deet hasn't got used to the elevator or stairs yet so we carried her, like usual. Also, if there is some scary place or thing outside, we usually carry her a few meters further.

### Achievements at the park

Deet really, _really_ enjoys being outdoors. Also, we have one 15m long leash and that has worked very well. It gives Deet more space to explore and she feels relaxed and excited. Also, the long leash helps us to train the "come here" command which works.. well, not perfectly, but every now and then, which has been a good start :)

The most awarding thing is to see how Deet has started to get excited about us as well. She comes every while to say "hello" to us if we sit in the park and sometimes she prefers to stay with us instead of exploring the park all the time.

Other achievement was the first outdoors poop! :D Every dog owner know how damn great thing that little daily routine is when it happens for the first time!

Also, Deet had good moments in the leash. She walked calmly and it's surprising thing has been that she doesn't pull at all. Only, if she gets scared and she needs to hide.

Yet, the walk doesn't go as planned. Deet loves to hide in the bushes if there is anything that makes her nervous. I think these are the proudest moments when she is hidden in the bushes like a little bunny and doesn't want to go out :D

Anyhow, the evening was super fun! We also tried to run a little with her so she could get little bit exercise. After the shelter life, long car trip and all the long sleeps she has had at our apartment, we need to get her to do some exercise little by little.

Even if we love to play and explore the park with Deet, we always give her time for her own. Usually, she goes little bit further to lay down for a little while and just observes what is going on in the park. All of us needs some me-time every now and then.

Later, we decided to have a water break and introduce a brush to  Deet. It didn't need a lot. As a hairy dog, she fell in love with the brush very fast!

We also realised that her fur has started to shine little bit more. It might be the salmon food we have given her, it should be good for the fur and skin.

So, it was a good day indeed! And we all got change to enjoy the beautiful summer evening.
