Today Deet was a little more afraid of everything and stayed mostly in her safe place. We're guessing it now sank in that she's in a new environment, and the new sounds stuff around here must be terrifying. However, at night the world became a calmer and more exciting place for her.

Milestones today:

* She ate, she drank and had treats.
* She let us pet her more.
* She got interested in nibbling on a bone.
* She did her business.
* She walked around the house.
* She gathered her toys and Mirkka's shoe in her safe place.

After a very long trip and such a big change of environment, dogs tend to require a lot of sleep. Sometimes, it might take even days to recover from the tiredness and shock. And so it was with Deet as well, and for that reason, we let her just rest today.

While we were worried that she might have been too scared for anything this day, we did notice some interesting thing. Apparently, Deet feels safer at night, so she's able to roam around the apartment, play a little more with her toys, and even gather around stuff that she finds interesting to decorate her safe place.

At night, we even caught her carrying Mirkka's shoe to her safe place! We thought this was a good sign of our scent, maybe comforting her (hopefully), so we let her do it. We also donated a couple of shirts and put them in her safe place so she would get used to our smells.
