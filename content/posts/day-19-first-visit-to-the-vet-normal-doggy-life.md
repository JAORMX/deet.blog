Deet has started to get our schedule. She eats in the morning, we go for a walk and the time we spend at home, she is with us. In the afternoon she we had the first appointment at the vet and she was super brave. In the evening, her amazing personality made us laugh and during the night we slept horribly due to looking after her that she doesn't lick her wound.

Milestones:

* Deet has got the schedule: she wakes up when we do
* She eats immediately when we give the food
* Going for a walk is easy with her
* She was super calm at the vet
* She let us clean her wound and she took her medicine (she is so kind!)
* Training sessions have paid off
* Feels like we have began a family <3

If we look 2 weeks back, this moment feels impossible: we can sit on the floor around 10 am, listen music from the laptop and Deet is chilling out with us, relaxed and having a great time with the chewing toy. The progress she has made is indescribable.

### Getting a daily rhythm

Eating and daily walks have started to find their place. Deet eats immediately in the morning when we give her the food. And she has started used to go for the walks.

After the walk we just stayed at home, played with Deet and let her rest before the vet appointment. After she had a little nap, we took her for a walk so she might be little bit calmer at the vet.

### The first vet appointment

We were quite sure Deet would be nervous at the appointment. Wrong again, we really underestimate her courage every now and then. She was very calm, smelled the room, sat besides us and when some other dog arrived to the place, she did nothing but sat calmly and observed what was going on.

It was a perfect moment to go to the vet: if the wound was clean day before now it was little bit infected. Apparently, some of the stitches of the castration didn't melt as they should have had and now the wound was little bit open. We got antibiotics and honey lotion. Otherwise she was totally healthy and fine. The vet told she is a bit skinny (even if her weight was 13,7kg?! :D) but it's normal for rescue dogs when they arrive.

All in all, everything went well. Now we just need to get the wound healed!

### Potty training challenges

Deet hasn't peed even one single time outside! Pooping is going better, but she always holds the pee until we are at home and does it so sneakily and fast that we have no chance to react. We read that taking the doggy diaper out could help. Not in Deet's case:

She gave us a good laugh. She loves sticks and branches and the best thing in the world is to find them in the nature. Here, Deet agains a root she found.

Training starts to pay off!

We have started little by little to train Deet some basic things, like her name,  "sit", "come" and "down". And little by little it starts to pay off.

We waited for a while outside but when Deet didn't give any signs of doing her business, we decided to go inside.

And... it took 2 minutes and there was a pond on our floor :D 

### Healing the wound

The wound was in worse condition than the day before, so it was perfect time to take her to the vet. The wound didn't really bother Deet before but today she had started to lick it every now and then, which was very bad! The vet told to put some old tricot shirt on Deet's hip so that she wouldn't lick the wound. 

We tried some options but they didn't work out. Deet got them off easily.

So in the end we decided to put one old T-shirt backwards. And that worked out. Deet was very kind when we put it on and she decided to go to sleep after that.

She looked so funny that we couldn't hold the laugh. But at the same time we were worried. It was hard to fall asleep, we both were just listening if she would try to get the shirt off. In the end all went fine and she slept the night very calmly.
