This was a sleepy day. For all of us :D I

Milestones:

* Deet (and us) slept insane good all day
* We had a great walk outside
* She really likes brushing the fur
* Deet shows more affection towards us <3

***

So, the idea of the day was to try to change Deet's schedule step by step. I think this video tells about our day more than 10000 words. Btw, this video is taken 5pm..

And after the video it took like and hour or two to slowly wake up.

I think there has been so much new things for all of us that it was ok to have a very slow and sleepy day. We all took naps and had a very lazy day. This didn't help our project to change the schedule, but I think the worth of sleep will be seen in some point.

Anyhow, Deet appeared to the living room in some point but when we were about to start to go out, she got somehow so scared that she decided to stay in her crate for a while again.

In the end we got out around 9:30 pm. But the walk was great and Deet was super excited like always outdoors.

The late evening walks have the positive side that there is not that much going on in the parks. And it has been great thing in the beginning when the main goal is just to get Deet to feel comfortable and create happy experiences to her.

We did very similar walk as during the day before. And we ended the walk to a chill brushing and scratching session.
