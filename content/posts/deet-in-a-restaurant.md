Today supposed to be our wedding day but we postponed the evet because of the pandemics. Anyhow, we wanted to celebrate our "almost a wedding day" by going to a restaurant. What would have been better than doing that with the whole family. 

Milestones:

* The wound looked better
* Deet is still having the better schedule
* Deet was first time in a restaurant
* She isn't scared of a thunder
* She behaves very well with other dogs
* She is playful and more and more familiar with us
