## The main day!

After months of waiting, the day was finally here. We went to pick up Deet! We must say that it has been maybe the most exciting day in our journey so far, and after all misfortune, there was this year because of the pandemics and all, this day felt somehow very special.

***

Milestones today:

* Deet arrived fine
* She found her safe spot (the crate)
* She slept, ate, drank, and did her business.
* We were able to wash her.
* She charmed us with her smile in the evening!

***

We arrived in the morning to the pick-up spot and we waited for the dogs to arrive. Due to the excitement, our appetite wasn't the best in the morning but we tried to have some snacks while waiting. The car was on time, which is incredible considering the time and the length they traveled with almost 40 dogs.

The morning was full of excitement! People from all over Finland came to pick up their new family members home after months of waiting.

Waiting for your dog to arrive is an emotional cocktail: excitement, happiness, nervousness, worry and relief, and plenty of other feelings.

Deet was the last dog in the first group. When she arrived she was tired, scared and yeah, a little bit smelly as well. It's a heart-melting moment, and it clarifies to you one straight goal: I am going to give her the best home ever!

We got some help to put the harness on and we went through all the important documents with the members of Kulkurit. After everything was ready, we were able to head home!

### The country girl arrives in the city

The change of life is huge for a rescue dog. Shelter life changes to the noisy city and everything, _everything_ is new. When we arrived at Helsinki, there was no chance to get Deet on her feet to walk. She was too tired and scared.

So we decided to carry her. Notice: About 10 kg heavy dog which is totally frozen of fear is not the lightest thing to carry.

### Basic needs go first

After a long car trip, anybody would be tired. When you add an extremely new environment and stress to the mix, it's the most important to have your basic needs filled and in check before anything else.

We were fortunate that Deet was very calm and everything went very well. She did her business, ate, and subsequently took a long nap. So we can call that a success!

We're not saying that she was in the most chill mood, nor that she was thrilled. We noticed she was scared and confused; which is completely understandable given the situation. So we tried to be extra slow and careful to try to make the process as easy as possible.

_Tips: Aroma-dog toy was a huge success! It has a calming aroma that calms down the dog's anxiety and stress. It was the first thing Deet took into her crate and she has slept with it since that._

### Smile before sleeping

The big day was about to end. But, before sleeping, Deet got some positive energy and gave us a little example of how charming and adorable dog she is when she has relaxed a little. After seeing her super stressed and scared all day, this little smile was the best closure for the day!

As you can see from this video, this crate really became Deet's safe spot! This is an example of how she was curious and excited, but how difficult that is when you need to always have your butt in your safe place!
