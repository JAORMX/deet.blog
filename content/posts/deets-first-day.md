Milestones today:

* Deet arrived fine
* She found her safe spot (the crate)
* She slept, ate, drank and did her business
* We were able to wash her
* She charmed us with her smile in the evening!

### The main day!

After months of waiting the day was finally here. We went to pick up Deet! We arrived in the morning to the pick-up spot and we waited for the dogs to arrive. Due to the excitement, the appetite wasn't the best in the morning but we tried to have some snacks while waiting.

The morning was full of excitement! People all over Finland came to pick up their new family members home after months of waiting and waiting.

Waiting for your dog to arrive is an emotional cocktail: excitement, happiness, nervousness, worry and relief, and plenty of other feelings.

Deet was the last dog in the first group. When she arrived she was tired, scared and yeah, a little bit smelly as well. We got some help to put the harness on and we went through all the important documents with the members of Kulkurit.

When everything was ready, we were ready to go home.

#### The country girl arrives in the city

The change of life is huge for a rescue dog. Shelter life changes to the noisy city and everything, _everything_ is new. When we arrived at Helsinki, there was no chance to get Deet on her feet to walk. She was too tired and scared.

So we decided to carry her. Notice: About 10 kg heavy dog which is totally frozen of fear is not the most lightest thing to carry.
