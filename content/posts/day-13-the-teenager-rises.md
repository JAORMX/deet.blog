Milestones:

* Her walks are getting smoother
* She has been more playful and running around
* Deet met one of our friends and took a treat from his hand.

With the renovations that are going on in our apartment building, we wanted to get Deet out early so she wouldn't get scared of the loud noises. This didn't go as planned, as the day is still her favourite time to sleep.

We tried it all, cheese treats, meatballs, sausages, chicken, but nothing seemed to work long enough. Deet would peek out her crate, after some attempts, she would finally get up, then eat a treat or two that are near her, and immediately fall back to her crate.

At some point, we realized this was a lost cause, and our teenager just needed her beauty sleep. So we let her have it. We went out briefly for a coffee, then one of us for exercise while the other one for some reading, then food. Our little one just slept.

Finally, the time came for the workers to reach our balcony. And it was loud. Deet, as expected, was terrified of the noises. So we decided the best thing to do was to actually pick her up from her safe place and get her outside.

Outdoors Deet is quite happy! Every time we get there, she shows us a lot of excitement and her playful side more than anywhere else. Today, like always outdoors, we had some great playing sessions together.

However, we did notice that today she was less willing to train or comply with our requests. We figured that since we "interrupted" her sleep, she might have been annoyed at us. She was doing this little tricks she hasn't done before and it looked like her real temper was coming out. Such as dropping her food to a ground before eating it, biting her leash and branches and not responding to us like before.

The leash biting was the biggest challenge today. We have taught her that no ("Ei!" in Finnish) is the word to stop doing it, but now she would stop, wait for a little, and then do it again. This was a mistake from our side, as we should have been teaching her the behaviour we _want to_ see, as opposed to reacting to the behaviour we don't want. We'll keep working on this.

Overall, she did walk very well on her leach, mostly following us and remaining very calm when other dogs were around. We had a very long walk together, which hopefully was a good exercise for her.

Today was her first close encounter with other dogs though. While she did remain very calm, we did notice her showing her teeth ever so slightly. Mostly we think that she's scared of other dogs. But, it seems that this is a behaviour we'll need to work on in the future.

After her resting at the park and feeling better, a friend of ours passed by after his jogging. We gave him a meatball to offer to Deet. While it took some time for her to seem comfortable while our friend was near, she eventually went near him, sniffed him, and even took a treat from him! While it wasn't the most heartfelt interaction, we can call it a success! It's the first time she meets one of our friends, and she looked quite comfortable with him around afterward.

Unfortunately, we had to cut the day outdoors shorter than expected because we found a tick in Deet's armpit. Fortunately, our apartment was nearby. We went there, without rushing Deet, read the instructions on how to remove ticks with a small device we had bought beforehand, and did it. Phew! It all went well! And, while did seemed quite confused, she immediately took the bone we gave her afterward and started chewing on it.

Finally, after being home and noticing most of the renovation was done, we decided to do a quick vacuuming of the apartment. While we did get some cleaning done, it seems that Deet is horrified by the vacuum cleaning sounds. So this is something we must work on soon. We gave her chicken popsicle to calm down and it worked out.

Even if  there are things that are going further everyday, we sometimes wonder, why doesn't Deet still show interest on going out or hanging out more with us at the apartment? For example, if we have had a fantastic day outdoors and Deet has been very calm and close with us. But then the next morning, she is not willing to do anything. She is not exploring the house, not approaching us nor showing interest going out. We don't know if her schedule is still too upside down or what, but we hope in some point she would be with us as chill as she is in the parks.
