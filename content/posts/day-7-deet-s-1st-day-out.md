I think the main learnings of this week is: Be patient! Every dog takes their own time and space to settle down! If I compare Deet during the first days and now in the end of the first week, she has done amazing job!

Milestones:

* Deet slept until 5pm and we knew there is nothing to worry about :D
* We went FOR A WALK!
* Deet has been more confident with us and our home
* She eats, drinks water, does her business like always 
* She still loves chicken <3

The day started slow - but it's ok! We know that is Deet's own time and that is our own time. Around 5 pm we started to boil some chicken because we knew it's going to be needed - today we are going out!

It takes time to get to know your dog. But I think so far we have done quite good job. It feels difficult to estimate if we are taking too big steps further or not. Today was a good example.

We boiled chicken to cheer Deet up. Even if Deet had her harness on already we needed to put the leashes and a collar on as well. With rescues it's important to have double leash in the beginning because if they get scared of some sound, they might run and fast!

Well.. Deet wasn't so happy about this
