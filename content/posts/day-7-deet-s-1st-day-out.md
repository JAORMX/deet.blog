I think the main learning of this week is: Be patient! Every dog takes their own time and space to settle down! Even if it sounds easy or clear, you really need to keep this in mind.

If we compare Deet during the first days and now in the end of the first week, she has done amazing job!

Milestones:

* Deet slept until 5pm and we knew there is nothing to worry about :D
* We went FOR A WALK!
* Deet has been more confident with us and our home.
* She eats, drinks water, does her business like always.
* She still loves chicken <3

The day started slow - but it's ok! We understand that is Deet's own time and that is our own time too. Around 5 pm we started to boil some chicken because we knew it's going to be needed - today we are going out!

It takes time to get to know your dog. But I think so far we have done quite a good job. It feels difficult to estimate if the steps we are taking are too big or not. Today was a good example.

We boiled chicken to cheer Deet up. Even if Deet had her harness on already we needed to put the leashes and a collar on as well. With rescues it's important to have double leash in the beginning because if they get scared of some sound, they might run away and fast!

Well.. Deet wasn't so happy about this
