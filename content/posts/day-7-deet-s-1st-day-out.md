I think the main learning of this week is: Be patient! Every dog takes their own time and space to settle down! Even if it sounds easy or clear, you really need to keep this in mind.

If we compare Deet during the first days and now in the end of the first week, she has done amazing job!

Milestones:

* Deet slept until 5pm and we knew there is nothing to worry about :D
* We went FOR A WALK!
* Deet has been more confident with us and our home.
* Deet learned not to bite the leash
* She eats, drinks water, does her business like always.
* She still loves chicken <3

The day started slow - but it's ok! We understand that it's Deet's own time and that it's our own time too. Around 5 pm we started to boil some chicken because we knew it's going to be needed - today we are going out!

It takes time to get to know your dog. But we think that so far we have done quite a good job. It feels difficult to estimate if the steps we are taking are too big or not. Today was a good example.

We boiled chicken to cheer Deet up. Even if she had her harness on already we needed to put the leashes and a collar on as well. With rescues it's important to have a double leash in the beginning because if they get scared of some sound, they might run away and fast!

Well.. Deet wasn't so happy about this

### Give time, then time and then a little gentle push

We let Deet be for a while so she could get used to the collar and leashes and that she could digest what just happened. At this point, we also considered that maybe it's too early to go out but on the other hand we still had that feeling that she can do it and she could even get excited outside.

So we gave it a try!

### The park worked!

Even if the new environment was intimidating, it was good idea to bring her outside. She was very curious but calm.

Interesting thing was that she found a safe spot also from the park. She sat down near to the pushes and returned back to the same place always, is something got her too nervous.

Other than that all went very well. First she mostly sat and observed what is happening around. But later, she also started to get interested in walking.

We gave her a bone to relax and enjoy her time at the park.

We also tried to have our first portrait. Apparently Deet wasn't excited to be in the picture first, but in the end we got quite a nice shot!

Such a great day!

One big milestone of the day was that Deet learned not to bite the leash! That required little bit of chicken and good timing :)

Also, she has started to approach us more which has been the best reward so far.
