# The night adventurer

This day was a good example of how to be patient. It's easy to say in theory that the dog might be tired and it needs to sleep a lot.  But when the dog is staying at the crate almost all day and seems to be totally out of energy, you'll get worried. In the end all went fine and I think this day was more learning lesson for us than for Deet!

Mailstones today

* Deet got familiar with the new room
* Deet was walking around little, took treat
* She was sleeping a lot (which is good and nothing to be worried about!!)
* She was exploring the house during the night

So in the evening, we got quite worried about Deet which seems very crazy now when you view the day afterward. She stayed in her crate almost all of the day and in the evening she looked like she had no energy AT ALL. She has slept before a lot too, but now it felt like the floor has some glue on it.

At some point in the day, Deet gained a little bit of energy when we hide some treats around the house and introduced our living room for her for the first time like that.

This made us think if she was sick or something. We contacted our contact person of Kulkurit in the evening and she said it’s probably just tiredness but let’s wait over the night and see how she is in the morning.

However, it was very soon obvious that she was not sick. Five minutes after turning off the lights, Deet was having the greatest adventure of her life. This was very positive to see and we hope during the time her schedule will turn to normal. Apparently we and the world is just too scary to handle during the day.

Another positive insight: In the day time we have hidden treats around the apartment and that has been the only way to get her out of the crate.

Apparently, it has made her more confident even if she doesn’t show it during the day. During the nights she is able to go to the same spots where she has found a treat during the day. So little success with that!
