This day was worrying. Deet stayed in her crate almost all of the day and in the evening she looked like she had no energy AT ALL. This made us think if she was sick or something. We contacted our contact person of Kulkurit in the evening and she said it’s probably just tiredness but let’s wait over the night and see how she is in the morning.

However, it was very soon obvious that she was not sick. Five minutes after turning off the lights, Deet was having the greatest adventure of her life. This was very positive to see and we hope during the time her schedule will turn to normal. Apparently we and the world is just too scary to handle during the day.

Another positive insight: In the day time we have hidden treats around the apartment and that has been the only way to get her out of the crate. Apparently, it has made her more confident even if she doesn’t show it during the day. During the nights she is able to go to the same spots where she has found a treat during the day. So little success with that!
