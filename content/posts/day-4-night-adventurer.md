This day was an excellent example of how to be patient. It's easy to say in theory that the dog might be tired, and it needs to sleep a lot. But, when the dog is staying at the crate almost all day and seems to be totally out of energy, one gets worried. In the end, all went fine, and we think this day was more of a lesson for us than for Deet!

Milestones today

* Deet got familiar with the new room.
* Deet was walking around little, took treats.
* She was sleeping a lot (which is good and nothing to be worried about!!)
* She was exploring the house during the night.
* All the basic needs were ok; food, sleep, water etc.

So in the evening, we were quite worried about Deet, which seems very crazy now when you view the day afterward. She stayed in her crate almost all of the day. In the evening, she looked like she had no energy AT ALL. She has slept before a lot too, but now it felt like the floor has some glue on it.

At some point in the day, Deet gained a little bit of energy when we hid some treats around the house and introduced our living room for her for the first time like that.

After these little steps, she stayed in her crate. This made us think if she was sick or something. We contacted our contact person of Kulkurit in the evening, and she said it’s probably just tiredness, but we agreed it's better to wait over the night and see how she is in the morning.

However, it was very soon apparent that she was not sick. Five minutes after turning off the lights, Deet was having the greatest adventure of her life. That was a very positive thing to see, and her energy and curiosity are amazing features when she gains a bit of bravery. Of course, we hope that with time her schedule will turn normal. Apparently, we and the world are just too scary to handle during the day.

Another positive insight: In the day time we have hidden treats around the apartment, and that has been the only way to get her out of the crate.

It seems it has made her more confident even if she doesn’t show it during the day. During the nights, she can go to the same spots where she has found a treat during the day. So little success with that!

After great adventures, it's good to lay down at the safe spot again, surrounded by all the toys.
