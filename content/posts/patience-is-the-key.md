Today the frustration raised it's head. Deet was sleeping and staying in her crate almost all day. The blue sky and sun shine were calling us to the parks but Deet decided to show up after 8 pm. After that, we has such amazing evening at home! But the day taught as many things again..

Mailstones

* Deet is getting more and more comfortable with us
* She was playful, excited and had her first runs inside the apartment
* Amazing progress with "look" (="katso") and "come here" ("tule") practices
* The feeling she has a lot of fun with us <3

This was the view all day. No clouds, sun is shining and little fresh wind was playing in the air.

But Deet sleeps.. and sleeps.... and sleeps.. and sleeps. Usually, she wakes up a little when we do our every day things in the apartment. But she doesn't come out from the crate and she seems very sleepy. Even if she didn't sleep, we can't go and lift her up because we don't want to violent her safe spot which has became so important to her.

So we just waited.. and waited.. and kept on waiting. And in some point you realise it's starts to feel little bit bad. It's not Deet's fault, it's us. We should not make expectation yet if another day goes very well. Also, we shouldn't be just waiting. We should do stuff while we wait even how hard it is to concentrate on other things while your dog is in the apartment.

We decided to give her some "me time" and we left outside to have a ice cream. Also, the break was healthy for us :D
