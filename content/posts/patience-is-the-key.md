Today the frustration raised it's head. Deet was sleeping and staying in her crate almost all day. The blue sky and sun shine were calling us to the parks but Deet decided to show up after 8 pm. After that, we has such amazing evening at home! But the day taught as many things again..

Mailstones

* Deet is getting more and more comfortable with us
* She was playful, excited and had her first runs inside the apartment
* Amazing progress with "look" (="katso") and "come here" ("tule") practices
* The feeling she has a lot of fun with us <3
