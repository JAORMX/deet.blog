Today the frustration raised it's head. Deet was sleeping and staying in her crate almost all day. The blue sky and sun shine were calling us to the parks but Deet decided to show up after 8 pm. After that, we has such amazing evening at home! But the day taught as many things again..

Mailstones

* Deet is getting more and more comfortable with us
* She was playful, excited and had her first runs inside the apartment
* Amazing progress with "look" (="katso") and "come here" ("tule") practices
* The feeling she has a lot of fun with us <3

This was the view all day. No clouds, sun is shining and little fresh wind was playing in the air.

But Deet sleeps.. and sleeps.... and sleeps.. and sleeps. Usually, she wakes up a little when we do our every day things in the apartment. But she doesn't come out from the crate and she seems very sleepy. Even if she didn't sleep, we can't go and lift her up because we don't want to violent her safe spot which has became so important to her.

So we just waited.. and waited.. and kept on waiting. And in some point you realise it's starts to feel little bit bad. It's not Deet's fault, it's us. We should not make expectation yet if another day goes very well. Also, we shouldn't be just waiting. We should do stuff while we wait even how hard it is to concentrate on other things while your dog is in the apartment.

We decided to give her some "me time" and we left outside to have a ice cream. Also, the break was healthy for us :D

The little me time for everyone was great and we had better energy after that.

We were chilling out at home and suddenly in the evening Deet decided to show up. We really wanted to go out, but putting the harness on took already so much effort and made Deet stay in her crate again so we started to give up with the idea. Also, learning point: we don't take the harness off for nights anymore!

We got her out form the crate with her one very favourite treat: chicken broth popsicles.

After the popsicles we decided to give a try to kongi because she seemed to have some energy now. We can't say she really got the idea of rolling the toy yet but she was happy to try to get them out by liking the toy :D

After this game she did her business inside and we really needed to clean her up. We gave her a shower, which was first quite uncomfortable to her but in the end she seemed even like it (?!). After the shower she got great energy and started to be playful and happy. As if we washed all the stress away :D

We started to train the basic "come here" and "look" with her and it went surprisingly well. She got very excited and clearly wanted to play as well. So decided to try another toy.

And it worked! This was the best tug of war game we have had with her so far. The toys and the concept of playing with them is so new to her that we just need to little by little introduce that her!

Later in the evening Deet really wanted to continue "come" and "look" training and it started to go very fluently

Here is a little tasting how excited she was.
