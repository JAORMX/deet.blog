Today supposed to be our wedding day but we postponed the evet because of the pandemics. Anyhow, we wanted to celebrate our "almost a wedding day" by going to a restaurant. What would have been better than doing that with the whole family.

Milestones:

* The wound looked better
* Deet is still having the better schedule
* Deet was first time in a restaurant
* She isn't scared of a thunder
* She behaves very well with other dogs
* She is playful and more and more familiar with us

This morning there was a thunder in Helsinki. Deet didn't really mind at all which was nice to see. Also, she is very used to music now. So we listened music a little while there was a bad weather and the thunder was not that loud.

In the morning we went for a long walk and everyhting went well. Deet has met many dogs during our walks and it has been nice to realise how happy and playful she is with other dogs.

After that, we took a little rest at home. We also cleaned the wound the second time of that day and fortunately the medicine seemed help. We have crushed the tablets to Deet's food and she has eaten them easily. 

In the afternoon we started to get ready for a celebration dinner. We supposed to get married this day but because of the pandemics the wedding was postponed. We wanted to do something to celebrate our "almost a  wedding day" and we wanted to do it with Deet. Also, it would have been irresponsible to leave her alone with her wound now. There is always a risk she still might lick it. 

Few days before, we called one of our favourite restaurants Taqueria el Rey and asked if the restaurant was a dog friendly. Their answer was kind a cute; they said they love dogs more than anything and they are super welcome! Also the waiter mentioned he has two dogs and he is a really fan of all kind of doggies. 

So we had a table reservation but before that we took Deet for a long walk in order to increase the energy. That makes it easier to go with her to a public places when she is little tired after some exercise. 

We had a very good Service at the restaurant and they gave us a peaceful corner to sit at. Deet was a little nervous to come inside but when we finally got inside we saw many smiling faces and people started immediately share there experiences about their dogs. Helsinki is super dog friendly city!

It was great to celebrate this big day all together. And it was nice to see that even if Deet was little bit nervous about the new situation, in the end she was resting and almost sleeping beside us while we ate. 

Before going home we had a little walk on our way home and at home we were spending some nice time with Deet. For the night, we needed to put the little "heavy metal looking shirt diaper" again, but she was totally ok with that and started to sleep when we did.

Even if the wedding was postponed, we were super lucky to share this day with Deet. The next day we'll have our first trip all together and we go to the country side to visit the parents of Mirkka.
