Today, we met friends, went for a doggy ice-cream and walked besides the busy car roads. And all went so well!! So proud of Deet <3

Milestones:

* She woke up around 4pm already!
* Deet walked very well besides busy and noisy car roads
* She was excited, playful and happy at the ice-cream place even if there were lot of people
* Deet behaved very well with a little child
* Deet was relaxed with our friend
* She was curios and excited at home 
* She fell asleep in the living room besides us <3

We opened a new door to Deet's life :D In fact, too of them The other door to the living room + the side door of the crate. This seemed to be a good change because it made Deet come out earlier because she saw more what we were doing.

And it was perfect timing because we were just about to go to have an ice-cream with our friend to JÃ¤delino, where they also sell some doggy ice-creams. So it would have been sad to go without her.

We tested Deet's limits today and we chose little bit busier street to walk. But she behaved so well! The cars didn't seemed to bother her so much, only the big buses and of course the biggest fear of Deet: motorcycles!
