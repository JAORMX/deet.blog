Today, we met friends, went for a doggy ice-cream and walked besides the busy car roads. And all went so well!! So proud of Deet <3

Milestones:

* She woke up around 4pm already!
* Deet walked very well besides busy and noisy car roads
* She was excited, playful and happy at the ice-cream place even if there were lot of people
* Deet behaved very well with a little child
* Deet was relaxed with our friend
* She was curios and excited at home
* She fell asleep in the living room besides us <3

We opened a new door to Deet's life :D In fact, too of them The other door to the living room + the side door of the crate. This seemed to be a good change because it made Deet come out earlier because she saw more what we were doing.

And it was perfect timing because we were just about to go to have an ice-cream with our friend to JÃ¤delino, where they also sell some doggy ice-creams. So it would have been sad to go without her.

We tested Deet's limits today and we chose little bit busier street to walk. But she behaved so well! The cars didn't seemed to bother her so much, only the big buses and of course the biggest fear of Deet: motorcycles!

### The best surprise: doggy ice-cream

We arrived at Teurastamo and met our friend Irene. Deet was very calm with her from very the beginning and now she got ice-cream from her. They have started to build very cute friendship step by step <3

The little grass area was so much fun for Deet! And she became very playfu and she seemed to have a great time. And no wonder - the sun was shining,  there was doggy ice-cream and friendly people around.

The leash biting is still a problem. We have tried many things: to associate the biting to her toy, stop playing if she bites the leash and continue when she doesn't bite it anymore.. Buuut if she is in a playful mode, she always starts it again and again. Still need to work on that!

The cutest moment was, when a little (1-2 years old) girl game with her mom to see Deet. They asked if the girl could pet Deet. I told yes but she might be little shy. "So is she", the mom told. After that we were watching how these two shy creatures were staring each others for several minutes and trying to gain courage. After some time "pop" the little girl touched Deet's nose and they both took a little shy step back. It was an amazing moment and we all left smile on our face. So well behaved Deet <3

On our way home we stopped for a pint with our friend to a beer garden, near to our home. The place wasn't crowded but there were some people and some background music. It took some minutes for Deet to get to used to it but when she found her own spot, she ate and fell asleep (!?). We took the table in the corner so she could also see all the time what is going on in the area.
