While Deet is adjusting very well to a new earlier schedule and becoming braver and braver. She is quite a shy pooper!

Milestones:

* Deet is friendlier and calmer towards other dogs
* She woke up earlier than before (at 12!)

***

Today, Deet started her day way earlier than before and even came out of her crate around 12. Making the best use of this time, we decided to take her outside as soon as we could.

The initial plan was to meet our friend Gabriel for lunch, thinking Deet would still be sleeping. However, given this new development, we decided to take Deet with us. Our friend surprised us by giving her a new toy monkey that he bought for her. She was very interested in it! Tanks Gabriel <3

To make things friendlier for Deet, we chose a sushi place with a nice big terrace where she could hang out and explore. This had mixed results. Deet got a little bored when we were eating, but it seems that she really liked the terrace! She played around and made sure we were busy. But it all went well. More and more she got used to our friend being around, and barely showed any signs of nervousness.

After lunch, we grabbed some iced-coffees to-go and sat with Deet and our friend in our closest park. She was really playful and seemed very keen on her new monkey toy. The toy made some screaming monkey sounds when you would press it in a certain way, and that scared Deet at first, but she was still interested and kept seeking her toy.

Our friend left and we decided to take Deet on a long walk. Since one of us likes running, the idea was to show Deet one running path so she would be acquainted with it, and in the future maybe she would be able to run along (or at least jog for a short time). So this is what we did. It was a warm day, so we made sure to have frequent stops and keep Deet hydrated.

We ended up at an outdoor cafÃ© by the shore, where we saw several other people with Dogs. Deet behaved very well, being slow and polite when introducing herself to other dogs, and very calm overall. She still has this tendency of sitting a little too far from us when we choose a spot, to the point where we have to move places. We usually laugh it off and say she's a teenager and needs to show other dogs that she's cool.

On the way back we noticed she got more and more tired. It might have been a little too long walk for her, so we carried her home where she promptly fell asleep. We made sure to keep a fan on her and some icy treats near her so she would refresh herself. She slept for some time.

Later that day, the same friend we met at the park joined us at home for some quesadillas. Deet was still very sleepy, but she didn't seem stressed. She just kept resting and we let her be. Later that day she decided to join and started walking around, curious about what we were doing. However, it is then that we noticed her "business walk", which she does just before she's about to relieve herself. We immediately took her outside for this.

But nothing happened. She was interested in everything, walking around, running around, smelling everything; but no business to be done. We were outside for couple of hours and still nothing.

 Our friend left, and we took Deet back up to the apartment, where she immediately started preparing herself for doing her business, so we took her out again.

It seems that she's not comfortable doing her business outside. Which is understandable as she got used to doing it inside... After several tries (and quite late at night), she finally did it outside, which we celebrated. Not only because we want her to know it's a good thing to do her business outside, but because we could finally get back to sleep.

Seems that she's a shy pooper, but that's OK, she'll learn with time and consistency.
