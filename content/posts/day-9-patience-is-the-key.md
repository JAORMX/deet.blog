Today the frustration raised its head. Deet was sleeping and staying in her crate almost all day. The blue sky and sunshine were calling us to the parks, but Deet decided to show up after 8 pm. After that, we had such a fantastic evening at home! But the day taught as many things again..

Milestones:

* Deet is getting more and more comfortable with us.
* She was playful, excited, and had her first runs inside the apartment.
* Amazing progress with "look" (="katso") and "come here" ("tule") practices.
* The feeling she has a lot of fun with us <3

This was the view all day. No clouds, the sun is shining, and little fresh wind was playing in the air.

But Deet slept, slept and slept... and then slept more. Usually, she wakes up a little when we do our every day things in the apartment. But she doesn't come out from the crate and she seems very sleepy. Even if she didn't sleep, we can't go and lift her because we don't want to mess with her safe spot, which has become so important to her.

So we just waited... and waited... and kept on waiting. And at some point, you realize that it starts to feel a little bit bad. It's not Deet's fault, it's us. We should not make expectations yet if another day goes very well. Also, we shouldn't be just waiting. We should do stuff while we wait even how hard it is to concentrate on other things while your dog is in the apartment.

We decided to give her some "me time," and we left outside to have ice cream. Also, the break was healthy for us :D

The little "me time" for everyone was great ,and we had better energy after that.

We were chilling out at home and suddenly in the evening, Deet decided to show up. We wanted to go out, but putting the harness on took already so much effort and made Deet stay in her crate again, so we started to give up with the idea.

We got her out from the crate with her one very favorite treat: chicken broth popsicles.

After the popsicles, we decided to give a try to kong toy because she seemed to have some energy now. We can't say she really got the idea of rolling the toy yet, but she was happy to try to get the food out by liking :D

After this game, she did her business inside the apartment, and we really needed to clean her up. We gave her a shower, which was at first quite uncomfortable for her, but in the end, she seemed even like it (?!).

After the shower, she got great energy and started to be playful and happy. As if we washed all the stress away :D We started to train the basic "come here" and "look" with her and it went surprisingly well. She got very excited and clearly wanted to play as well. So decided to try another toy.

And it worked! This was the best tug of war game we have had with her so far. The toys and the concept of playing with them are so new to her that we just need to little by little introduce that her!

Later in the evening Deet really wanted to continue "come" and "look" training and it started to go very fluently

Here is a little taste of how excited she was when calling her in the evening.

Before sleeping, Deet continued coming to us even if we didn't give treats anymore. She let us pet her and she seemed calm and happy.

In the end, the day that felt so difficult turned out to have a lot to give!![](/images/20200713_010238.jpg)
