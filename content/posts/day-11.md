This was a sleepy day. For all of us :D

Milestones:

* Deet (and us) slept insane good, all day
* We had a great walk outside.
* She really likes us brushing her fur.
* Deet shows more affection towards us <3

***

So, the idea of the day was to try to change Deet's schedule step by step. We think this video tells about our day more than 10000 words. By the way, this video is taken 5pm...

And after the video, it took like and hour or two for her to slowly wake up.

We think there have been so many new things for all of us, that it was ok to have a very slow and sleepy day. We all took naps and had a very lazy day. This didn't help our project to change the schedule, but we think the worth of sleep will be seen in some point.

Anyhow, Deet appeared in the living room at some point in the day, but when we were about to start heading out, she got somehow so scared that she decided to stay in her crate for a while again.

In the end, we got out around 9:30 pm. But the walk was great and Deet was super excited like always outdoors.

The late evening walks have a positive side: There isn't that much going on in the parks. And it has been a great thing in the beginning, when the main goal is just to get Deet to feel comfortable and create happy experiences for her.

We did a very similar walk as the day before. And we ended the walk with a chill brushing and scratching session.

After the walk it was time to go home. Deet walked all the way back, even crossed the car road, which is usually too scary to cross by herself.

Not so eventful day, but it I think it was needed for all of us :)
