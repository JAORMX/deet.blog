We are very into outdoor activities and we really would like Deet to join us. To our surprise, Deet is a fantastic outdoor dog and seems to enjoy nature a lot. This is a summary of all the long weekend we had at Mirkka's parent's place and how amazing this little "shy" dog was there.

Milestones:

* Deet loves being outdoors.
* She likes sniffing plants and flowers.
* She walked beside us the whole time.
* When wanting her own time, she does so fairly near us.
* Deet has been brave and made friends with other family members.
* She plays with my (Mirkka's) parents and lets them pet her.
* Deet comes always to sleep beside us in our room and she is super excited about us when we wake up.
* Her schedule is now normal. She wakes up around 7-8 am!
* She is a perfect berry picking dog; she always stays beside us, lays down while we pick berries, and usually starts to bite some branches beside us. We all have something to do.
* She has started to recognize the family: if we leave, she starts to follow or gets worried if we are in a sauna and she stays with my parents. Fortunately she's ok in few minutes.
* She poops and finally did her first pee outside :D
* Eating schedule is working and she has learned to sit before getting the food.
* She's used to being in the car nowadays with her doggy seatbelt on.

While hanging out at Mirkka's parent's place in the countryside, we have done some trips to the forest with Deet. We were very surprised at how calm and interested she has been on these trips, and are very excited that we'll be able to do more outdoor activities in the future.

The first quick trip we did was to a local forest to do some berry picking. While Deet wasn't too keen on getting on the car, she is quite calm when it comes to the car trip itself.

Once we were there, she was very calm and seemed very interested too. She started sniffing around the area but stayed close to us.

A very nice thing is that she always stays close to us and mostly walks on the visible trails (as we do). However, when it comes to picking berries and the times where we have to go into bushes, she follows. When we would stop to pick berries, she would chill out and lay down near us.

We've tried giving Deet some berries to smell, but she didn't seem too interested in that. She sure was interested, however, in chewing branches and grass. Sometimes we joke that Deet is our little sheep.

### Deet and the family

To our surprise, Deet wasn't very afraid of the other family members. The first day she didn't let people pet her, but she was with everyone all the time, slept in the middle of the living room while people pass by and she seemed very relaxed. The next day with the family, she let people touch her already, and at the granny's place she approach immediately the granny.

We had a lovely day in the forest and it felt like Deet had always been part of the family.

After four days she went already for a walk with my parents, without us. She walked well almost all the time. Only at one point near to the home, she stopped to look back and she was a little bit confused about why we didn't join for the walk. But treats helped :D

Also, huge thanks for the amazing doggy grandparents my parents have been for her. They gave a very warm welcome to our new family member <3

### Deet "doggying" around

Now when Deet has started to get more energy and she has become braver, she has started to do some little tricks behind our back. That has been amazing to see because it basically tells us that she feels comfortable. Of course, at the same time, it means, we need to be more and more aware what is she doing :D Every now and then, we found her eating our socks in the living room, biting a tape roll, trying to eat curtains or breaking the newspapers she found.

Also, one morning we woke up and saw how she had taken our clothes from the open bag, put them on the floor and slept on them. It's hard to hold a laugh when you wake up and see this:

Deet likes biting stuff and she is also very active. So we need to find her fun activities during the day. She seemed to like newspapers so we did an activation toy by putting some newspapers on the box and she needed to find treats there. Cheap and easy!

### One big family

In the beginning, Deet didn't really care about our company. She had me-time all day long and didn't really care if we were with her or not. Now, she starts to be the opposite. Where ever we are, she will be there.

A basic evening chilling out all us together.

The good thing is that even if she really likes our company now, she still knows how to take her own me-time and takes long naps during the day.

By the way! Deet knows now a cool thing when she gets her food.

### Back home - sleeping in the train & pooping in the mall

Deet has been very calm also when we travel. She sits or sleeps in the car and again, she slept almost the whole train trip.

Even if the trip went well, Deet gave a nice surprise in the Tripla mall where the train arrived. Out of nowhere, she decided to poop in the middle of the mall. Not the proudest moments as a dog owner I must say...

### Amazing milestones in one month!

If you have read the blog posts from the beginning, you might slightly remember the little shy dog in a crate? We hardly do anymore :D Deet has gained amazing courage and every day we can basically sit and wonder how brave she is.

We still have a huge problem with potty training - she still pees inside and it's tricky to try to get rid of that habit. Even if we take her out several times a day, we have taken the doggy diapers out, done "boring" walks so that she would just do her business, she still holds it until she gets inside and does it on the floor... We still have a lot to do about this!

But, I am sure we'll find the way :)
