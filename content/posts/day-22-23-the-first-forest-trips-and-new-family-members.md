We are very into outdoor activities and we really would like Deet to join us. To our surprise, Deet is a fantastic outdoor dog and seems to enjoy nature a lot.

Milestones:

* Deet loves being outdoors.
* She likes sniffing plants and flowers.
* She walked beside us the whole time.
* When wanting her own time, she does so fairly near us.
* Deet has been brave and made friends with other family members.
* She plays with my (Mirkka's) parents and let them pet her.
* Deet comes always to sleep besides us in our room and she is super excited about us when we wake up
* Her schedule is now normal. She wakes up arounf 7-8 am!
* She is a perfect berry picking dog; she always stays beside us, lays down while we pick berries and usually starts to bite some branches besides us. We all have something to do.
* She has started to recognise the family: if we leave, she starts to follow or gets worried if we are in a sauna and she stays with my parents. Fortunately she's ok in few minutes.
* She poops and finally did her first pee outside :D
* Eating schedule is working and she has learned to sit before getting the food.
* She's used to being in the car nowadays with her doggy seatbelt on.

While hanging out at Mirkka's parent's place in the countryside, we have done some trips to the forest with Deet. We were very surprised at how calm and interested she has been on these trips, and are very excited that we'll be able to do more outdoor activities in the future.

The first quick trip we did was to a local forest to do some berry picking. While Deet wasn't too keen on getting on the car, she is quite calm when it comes to the car trip itself. Once we were there, she was very calm and seemed very interested too. She started sniffing around the area but stayed close to us.

A very nice thing is that she always stays close to us and mostly walks on the visible trails (as we do). However, when it comes to picking berries and the times where we have to go into bushes, she follows. When we would stop to pick berries, she would chill out and lay down near us. We've tried giving Deet some berries to smell, but she didn't seem too interested in that. She sure was interested, however, in chewing branches and grass. Sometimes we joke that Deet is our little sheep.
