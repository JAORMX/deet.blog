Today we went to see doggy grandparents to the country side. It was Deet's first trip. We took a train from Helsinki and the trip went better than we could have ever thought. Also, Deet was excited about her "doggy grandparents" and the house they have.  There was almost no signs of that shy little dog we had exactly 3 weeks ago.

* Deet was travelling in a train and she was very calm and slept most of the trip
* She was calm in the car 
* She was excited about Mirkka's parents and wasn't afraid with them
* Deet explored the house immediately, ate, drank water and seemed very relaxed
