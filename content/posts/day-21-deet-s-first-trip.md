Today we went to see doggy grandparents in the countryside. It was Deet's first trip. We took a train from Helsinki and the trip went better than we could have ever thought. Also, Deet was excited about my (Mirkka's) parents and the house they have.  There were almost no signs of that shy little dog we had exactly 3 weeks ago.

* Deet was traveling on a train and she was very calm and slept most of the trip
* She was calm in the car
* She was excited about Mirkka's parents and wasn't afraid of them
* Deet explored the house immediately, ate, drank water and seemed very relaxed
* She has learned to sit before we give the food in front of her
* The wound is getting better and better

Time to go! We took an afternoon train so that we're able to take Deet for a long walk in the morning and get her tired before the trip. Also, we hoped there wouldn't be so many people on Saturday afternoon. We wanted to be careful with coronavirus but also it would be an easier first trip to Deet if the train wasn't full. Our plan worked and we were very lucky - only a few people in the same car.

First, Deet was observing like always. She was sitting on the lap and she was very calm. After 5-10 minutes, she got very curious.

In a few minutes she started to calm down and she was sitting on a chair like a proper traveler.

Soon, she started to sleep on the lap and she was sleeping and resting the whole rest of the few hours train trip.

### Meeting other family members

My family was excited to meet Deet. We were not sure how Deet would behave in the new environment but in the end, everything went very smoothly.

My dad came to pick us up from the train station. We had bought a safe belt for Deet and the 30 min car trip went well in all ways.

When we arrived at their home, Deet was first exploring the yard. We gave a tip to my parents that they should not approach Deet before she had approached them. That makes it easier for Deet to gain courage to get to know them when she is ready. This worked well and Deet started to be confident sooner than we could have imagined.

Deet was surprisingly confident. She started to explore the house and she didn't look nervous at all. She was just curious and excited. It's unbelievable! If we look 2 weeks back, we went first time OUT! Now she was in a new environment, with new people and she was walking around without any signs of nervousness. No words, how brave this lady dog is!

Also, it was a good sign that she was eating. She wouldn't have done that if she wasn't feeling ok. We have started to teach her to sit before we give her the food. It has started to work and today she sat almost immediately when we showed the plate with food.

The only problem was that she didn't do her business. She peed inside (againâ€¦) but nothing else.

### Good night

Deet found her spot from our room as soon as we arrived and left our stuff there. When we started to sleep, she came to sleep on the floor beside our bed. It felt pretty much like a perfect day!

Tomorrow Deet will have her first forest trip! :)
