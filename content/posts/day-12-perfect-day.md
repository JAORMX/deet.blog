Deet woke us up! Deet?! So we went out in the morning and had maybe the best day outdoors this summer, so far. Deet is an amazing dog and we couldn't be more happy and proud to have her in our family.

Milestones

* EVERYTHING! :D
* Deet woke up early and we were outdoors already at 8:30 am!
* She seemed to find safety from us when she faced something scary.
* She was relaxed and calm with us, even took a nap in the middle of the park beside us.
* We were playing, running, training basic things and chilling out all together.
* She did her business outside.
* We all just had a great day <3

We are having the most annoying balcony renovation this summer. Most of the time nothing happens, but every now and then we get a small piece of paper which tells us to remove everything form our balcony for a day and two. This basically means we don't have a living room during that time because all our balcony stuff is there.

The day before, we were wondering how the heck we'll get Deet out in the morning before the renovations starts - last day she woke up at 10 pm! :O

Well, it was easier than we thought because this time Deet was awake before us, and she came to walk in our bedroom to wake us up. We wonder if it was the water that had fallen during the night and made her thirsty.. But anyhow, it was 8 am and we were ready to go out!

The morning was shocking for Deet. All the sounds, traffic, people, light, everything was so much more overwhelming than during the evening time. Basically, durning the first 20 mins, Deet was in bushes. She didn't want to walk at all...

After carrying her for a while she started to calm down, and recognised her favourite spot at the park. We had a breakfast there and it was the first one we all have had together outdoors.

Deet's progress with everything has been mind blowing! A few days ago she didn't know what a toy is. Now we had already great games together and she seemed very happy. This moments with her are priceless.

The best thing about this day was that we felt we were at the park all together. It wasn't anymore us taking Deet out. She was with us as much as we were with her. She came to sit and chill out with us, and this was the first time she started to follow us if one of us went back home to pick something.

Today Deet also considered us a safe place. For example, when another dog was walking nearby, Deet came behind us. Before, she always ran behind a tree or near to the bushes. It was good to realize that we were now a safe harbour in her mind.

An amazing thing about Deet is how excited she is about everything when she gains more confidence, but she still is very calm and thoughtful. It feels like she is always thinking for a long time before she acts :D . 

Anyhow, if we don't count the times she is sitting in some random bushes like a rabbit, with this lady there is no such a thing as boring moment. During the warm summer day is good to cool down with some frozen treats.

We have also continued our little training sessions with her because it always seems to make her happy and excited. This is not very goal oriented training but we have tried some basic things such as her name, look, come her and sit. Deet seems to get energy and confidence in each of this little funny sessions we have.

At the end of the long day the amazing milestone was when Deet took a nap like this. The leg under her didn't almost have any blood circulation anymore but it's ok. It was such a great moment to have with this little one <3

One interesting side about Deet has been that she hasn't barked. Not even a single little time. We don't know if she is even able to, but so far she has not made a sound.
