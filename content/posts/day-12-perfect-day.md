Deet woke us up! Deet?! So we went out in the morning and had maybe the best day outdoors this summer so far. Deet is an amazing dog and we couldn't be more happy and proud to have her in our family.

Milestones

* EVERYTHING! :D
* Deet woke up early and we were outdoors already at 8:30 am!
* She seemed to find safety from us when she faced something scary.
* She was relaxed and calm with us, even took a nap in the middle of the park beside us.
* We were playing, running, training basic things and chilling out all together.
* She did her business outside.
* We all just had a great day <3

We are having the most annoying balcony renovation this summer. Most of the time nothing happens but every now and then we get a small piece of paper which tells us to remove everything form our balcony for a day and two. This basically means we don't have a living room during that time because all our balcony stuff is there.

The day before, we were wondering how the heck we'll get Deet out in the morning before the renovations starts - last day she woke up at 10 pm! :O

Well, it was easier than we thought because this time Deet was awake before us and she came to walk in our bedroom to wake us up. We wonder if it was the water that had fallen during the night and made her thirsty.. But anyhow, it was 8 am and we were ready to go out!

The morning was shocking for Deet. All the sounds, traffic, people, light, everything was so much more overwhelming than during the evening time. Basically the first 20 mins Deet was in bushes. She didn't want to walk at all..

After carrying her for a while she started to calm down and recognised her favourite spot at the park. We had a breakfast at the park and it was the first one we all have had together outdoors.

Deet's progress with everything has been mind blowing! Few days ago she didn't know what is a toy. Now we had already a great games together and she seemed very happy. This moments with her are priceless.
