Deet has started to wake up earlier. Because of that, we haven't been able to write as much as before we did. Now when she is more active during the days, have had longer days with her and it has been great! She has almost abandoned her crate and she is nowadays like a real dog, being with us in the living room and asking us to play with her!

Deet has had amazing progress with her schedule. Now she is awake in the mornings and we have went out already around 11-12 am. Also, she is now connecting that opening the front door means that she can go out.
