Deet has started to wake up earlier. Because of that, we haven't been able to write as much as before we did. Now when she is more active during the days, have had longer days with her and it has been great! She has almost abandoned her crate and she is nowadays like a real dog, being with us in the living room and asking us to play with her!

Milestones:

* Deet woke up quite early
* She has started to learn that opening the front door means going out
* We were able to call her out even if she was resting in her crate
* Deet loves more and more brushing
* She starts to find her new spot at the living room

***

Deet has had amazing progress with her schedule. Now she is awake in the mornings and we have went out already around 11-12 am. Also, she is now associating that opening the front door means that she can go out. So even if she has been in her crate, we have been able to get her out from there for a walk. It's a HUGE milestone!!

## Deet having a grumpy day

Somehow the day 17 was Deet's grumpy day. It was even hilarious in the end - she has never been as serious as she was today! What ever we did, she seemed to be little bit annoyed. She didn't smile during the whole day and it was weird.

She had this face all day ^^ The reason might have been tiredness. We went for a walk during the noon and we has a plan to meet some friends in the afternoon. The problem was that we came home to eat before going out with the friends. In some point, Deet decided to take a nap exactly 30 mins before we supposed to go.

She came out by herself when we opened the front door but apparently she was very sleepy all day. When we went for a picnic, she stayed far away all the time and if she has some energy, she decided to eat her leash. She really didn't show her brightest side today to our fiends :D But that how the doggy life goes sometimes.

### A spa after the grumpy day

The grumpy day got nice ending when we decided to brush Deet completely. Also, she had some tiny rastas which we cut away. "We broke our dog" was the feeling when Deet sank in a trance during the brushing :D

Even the paws were easy to check because she was having a very deep sleep.

Rest of the evening she slept in our living room.
