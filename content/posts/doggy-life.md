Long time no writing! And there is only one reason for this: the vacations ended and after work days we haven't felt like writing a blog. We have wanted to spend time with Deet. Everything has went well and it's incredible how much happiness Deet has brought to our family.

Milestones:

* Deet is potty trained! (Wippiii!!!!!)
* She is more used to buses, trams and other big vehicles that cause fear before
* She approaches more people
* Deet has been in the dog parks and she has come along very well with other dogs
* We started dog training classes and she has been super excited there
* Deet realised what is a sofa and now she is always with us chilling out on it
* She has started to sleep besides our bed every night
* She has gotten excited about water; she gets crazy energy after shower or swimming
* Everyday things work well: eating, sleeping, playing, daily walks etc.
* We bought a dog camera and it seems like she behaves very well if we are gone.
* It feels like Deet feels safe enough to show her real personality. And it's awesome.

## Everyday life works

Sometimes it's difficult to remember how scared Deet was when she arrived.   
Or how difficult it was to create routines for eating and going out with Deet. Now, these things just work and it's huge progress.

The potty training happened more like and accident. Deet learned to do the big business out in some point, but she peed inside the house over a month. One day she had some problem to poop and she accidentally peed outside. Her face was horrified but like that she realised it's ok :D 

## Training lessons

We had taught Deet some basic commands at home and she seemed to learn well and she enjoyed the training sessions. We decided to join to one everyday basic training course and so far everything has went well. Deet likes to go there, she is very excited and she also learn fast. The best thing is to spend time together and have a fun hobby to share.
