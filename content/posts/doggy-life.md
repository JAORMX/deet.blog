Long time no writing! And there is only one reason for this: the vacations ended and after work days we haven't felt like writing a blog. We have wanted to spend time with Deet. Everything has went well and it's incredible how much happiness Deet has brought to our family.

Milestones: 

* Deet is potty trained! (Wippiii!!!!!)
* She is more used to buses, trams and other big vehicles that cause fear before
* Deet has been in the dog parks and she has come along very well with other dogs
* We started dog training classes and she has been super excited there
* Deet realised what is a sofa and now she is always with us chilling out on it
