## Deet loves chicken!

Today we discovered that our little Deet has a strong love for chicken!

***

Milestones today:

* We discovered that Deet loves chicken
* Deet was way more active in the house following chicken pieces

***

As mentioned in the previous blog post, in the morning Deet was shy and stayed in the crate. This happened today as well. However, we noticed some signs that she had been active at night:

* She rearranged her toys
* She brought one of the new toys inside her crate
* She was laying beside a missing shoe, cuddling with it

This was the first morning where we got worried and a little sad that she wasn’t coming out of her crate and seemed very scared. So we decided to give her space.

Our amazing contact from Kulkurit asked how we were doing and advised us to try giving her treats of boiled chicken. So we gave that a try, and… Jackpot!

She changed from night to day!

First, we just gave her some treats in front of her crate. This cheered her up and she started approaching us more. At some point, we thought it was enough and decided to give her space again. However, Deet had something else in her mind… she was curious and wanted more of that tasty chicken!

This helped her explore our apartment a lot more than before, which made us very happy and excited for her.
