A little wound in Deet's belly got worse today. We think she has had it since she arrived but we saw it when se started to be more social with us and let us to see her belly. In that time, it was already having a scar so we thought it's getting better. But today, it was open and red. We booked a vet and got appointment for tomorrow. Other than that, normal and great day with Deet! :)

Milestones

* Deet was awake earlier again
* We started the first training sessions
* She was few hours alone at home and all went fine
* She was playful 
* Deet was walking well in the leash!
* Deet came out again when we called her at the front door
* Trying to get her used to the elevator
* We used Firstvet application for the first time and it was great!

It has been amazing to see that Deet is awake, really awake in the mornings now. Her look is brighter and she is ready for an action! Also, she is not sleeping in her crate anymore, she sleeps in the living room. She has basically abandoned the crate, now she is all the time with us in the house.
