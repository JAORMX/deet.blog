A little wound in Deet's belly got worse today. We think she has had it since she arrived but we saw it when se started to be more social with us and let us to see her belly. In that time, it was already having a scar so we thought it's getting better. But today, it was open and red. We booked a vet and got appointment for tomorrow. Other than that, normal and great day with Deet! :)

Milestones

* Deet was awake earlier again
* We started the first training sessions
* She was few hours alone at home and all went fine
* She was playful
* Deet was walking well in the leash!
* Deet came out again when we called her at the front door
* Trying to get her used to the elevator
* We used Firstvet application for the first time and it was great!

It has been amazing to see that Deet is awake, really awake in the mornings now. Her look is brighter and she is ready for an action! Also, she is not sleeping in her crate anymore, she sleeps in the living room. She has basically abandoned the crate, now she is all the time with us in the house. It's fantastic!

Today Deet woke up earlier again! So we decided to go out.

But today we saw that the wound on her belly was red and had bled a little. It wasn't clear what it was, but after sharing thoughts and photos with others in our dear whatsapp group with other new adoption families, we started to think it might be from the stitches they put after the castration. During the first week we didn't see it, because she didn't come out or show her stomach to us. But when we saw it, it had a scar already. For some reason, the wound was open now.

Deet was totally fine, the wound didn't bother her at all. The problem was more one specific owner who was worried like hell ( :D ). We booked the vet but because the first appointment was for the next day, we decided to try the Firstvet application.

The application offers video appointment with a vet. You can describe the issue and add photos as well. The booking is easy and we got an appointment already in 30 mins. The vet told us, the wound looks like it has had stitches after the castration and it's important to keep it clean and observe it doesn't get infected. After that, we got instructions to the email. 

To be honest, this appointment was more to relief the owner, not because of the emergency of Deet :D

### Me-time

We decided to leave Deet alone for few hours. We have spent a lot of time with her now, and it's important to teach her to have some time on her own as well. 

We came home after few hours and Deet was sleeping. Apparently, she had took few of her toys to the living room while we were gone. It melted our hearts.
