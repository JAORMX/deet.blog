Deet is enjoying more and more being outdoors! However, the ticks are enjoying her being outdoors too...

Milestones:

* Deet walked very smoothly on her leash.
* She seemed quite calm while we ate near foot trucks.
* She met another friend of ours and reacted very calmly.

Today we let Deet sleep in the morning and decided to give her some time of her own. While she slept, we left to get a coffee and some breakfast. We missed our doggy though, so we decided to come back fairly early and see how she's doing.

After the long walk, we arrived to an area with food trucks. While there wasn't a lot of people, it was fairly noisy due to the generators used to keep electricity in the trucks. Deet handled that quite well, and even ended up taking a quick nap while we were sitting on the grass. We've been quite adamant in not giving Deet any food from our plates or any leftovers, and this seems to have payed off. We had a pizza, and the smell of it got Deet quite interested in it, however, after some sniffs, she stopped poking at it and just laid down and rested.

We did a second attempt at getting Deet interested in swimming. It was here, however, that we noticed a little bump below her fur. To our
