Deet is enjoying more and more being outdoors! However, the ticks are enjoying her being outdoors too...

Milestones:

* Deet walked very smoothly on her leash.
* She seemed quite calm while we ate near foot trucks.
* She met another friend of ours and reacted very calmly.
* Deet met another dog and started to play with him immediately. It was a great sign <3

Today we let Deet sleep in the morning and decided to give her some time of her own. While she slept, we left to get a coffee and some breakfast. We missed our doggy though, so we decided to come back fairly early and see how she's doing.

Around 1pm, she looked like she needed to do her business, so we hurried up, packed her things, grabbed her, and took her out. Unfortunately, she didn't quite get to the park, and she relieved herself in the garage of the apartment building. But hey! close enough!

We cleaned up after her, and since we were outside already, we started her walk. This time she seemed a lot more confident and walked very smoothly with her leash. Mostly with her the leash is quite loose and she is well aware of where we're going while we walk. Mostly she's still afraid of loud sounds like big cars more motorcycles. But nowadays she is even able to cross the street with us.

Since it was a hot day, we walked by the sea in hopes that she would get a quick swim. Of course, being Deet's first time seeing the sea, it was a little intimidating at first. But she seemed to adapt fairly quickly. Unfortunately, no swimming was made, but we sure enjoying walked near there!

After the long walk, we arrived to an area with food trucks. While there wasn't a lot of people, it was fairly noisy due to the generators used to keep electricity in the trucks.

Deet handled that quite well, and even ended up taking a quick nap while we were sitting on the grass. 

We've been quite adamant in not giving Deet any food from our plates or any leftovers, and this seems to have payed off. We had a pizza, and the smell of it got Deet quite interested in it, however, after some sniffs, she stopped poking at it and just laid down and rested.

We did a second attempt at getting Deet interested in swimming. It was here, however, that we noticed a little bump below her fur. To our dismay, it was a tick! And unfortunately we didn't carry with us the tick removing tool. So we hurried to the nearest pharmacy to buy it. Removing the tick from Deet went fairly smoothly, however, we felt concerned that there might be more on her. We kept checking her fur, and ended up finding a couple more ticks, which we promptly removed.

Needless to say we got a little stressed by this situation, but thankfully none of them were of considerable size, so they must have been there a fairly short time.

Finally we walked all the way back to the park nearest to our home and decided to stick around there. Still, we couldn't shake the feeling that there might be more of them on her. And yes, we found the last tick on Deet!
