Deet is a rescue dog from Romania. She was found 18th 2019 from the field nearby the M.G. Rescue dog shelter. Nobody knows how she and the other puppy appeared there. After time passed, they also realised that the dogs were not even siblings which made the story even more strange. Anyhow, Mihail from the shelter started to take care of them and that is how their journey to have a new life began.

In this point we must highlight how amazing association [Kulkurit](https://kulkurit.fi/) “Hobo dogs” is. The adoption process is always very thorough and people who work volunteeringly in the association are doing fantastic work finding good homes for the dogs. All the dogs are  following a strict vaccination program and they’ll have an EU pet passport and the chip in their ear. Each of the adoption parents get a contact person who will walk along the whole adoption process. For us, our contact person has been irreplaceable. Thank you!!

Deet was at the M.G. Rescue dog shelter where she was taken good care. Those months we tried to follow the shelter’s social media if our dog would appear even a second or two in some of the videos they posted.
