Deet is a rescue dog from Romania. She was found 18th 2019 from the field nearby the M.G. Rescue dog shelter. Nobody knows how she and the other puppy appeared there. After time passed, they also realized that the dogs were not even siblings which made the story even more strange. Anyhow, Mihail from the shelter started to take care of them and that is how their journey to have a new life began.

Deet was around 7 months at the M.G. Rescue dog shelter where she was taken good care.

Deet was described to be a happy puppy who came along with other dogs and people. Also, she seemed curious and excited about new things. Her temper and estimated size seemed perfect for us. The activity level might change after the shelter life a lot but estimations sounded good as well. PLUS she was the most cutest puppy in the world so we decided to contact Kulkurit and ask if we would have a chance to adopt her.

At this point, we must highlight how amazing association [Kulkurit](https://kulkurit.fi/) “Hobo dogs” is. The adoption process is always very thorough, responsible and people who work as voluntaries in the association are doing fantastic work finding good homes for the dogs. All the dogs are following a strict vaccination program and they’ll have an EU pet passport and the chip in their ear. Each of the adoption parents gets a contact person who will walk along the whole adoption process. For us, our contact person has been irreplaceable. **Thank you!!**
