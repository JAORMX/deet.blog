Deet is a rescue dog from Romania. She was found 18th 2019 from the field nearby the M.G. Rescue dog shelter. Nobody knows how she and the other puppy appeared there. After time passed, they also realized that the dogs were not even siblings which made the story even more strange. Anyhow, Mihail from the shelter started to take care of them and that is how their journey to have a new life began.

At this point we must highlight how amazing association [Kulkurit](https://kulkurit.fi/) “Hobo dogs” is. The adoption process is always very thorough and people who work as voluntaries in the association are doing fantastic work finding good homes for the dogs. All the dogs are following a strict vaccination program and they’ll have an EU pet passport and the chip in their ear. Each of the adoption parents gets a contact person who will walk along the whole adoption process. For us, our contact person has been irreplaceable. Thank you!!

Deet was at the M.G. Rescue dog shelter where she was taken good care. Those months we tried to follow the shelter’s social media if our dog would appear even a second or two in some of the videos they posted.

During these months we consumed [Zak George](https://www.dogtrainingrevolution.com/ "Zak George")’s books and youtube videos about dog training and watched webinars the Koiruuksien Klubi offered. We highly recommend all those resources for people who are planning to have a dog!

Adoption process, pandemics… connect people!

The Covid-19 was slowing down the adoption process because the countries shut down and closed their borders. Sometimes waiting felt endless but the Kulkurit association had a great idea: Let’s share the waiting process and build a Facebook group for people in the same situation.

And so it happened and in the end, we had an awesome support group around. People shared not only tips and questions related to the arriving dogs but also all the excitement, happiness, and frustration that the waiting during the pandemics brought up. In the end, we also created a WhatsApp group which became one of the best things during the whole waiting process and after having the dog home. Can’t wait to see these amazing people and their dogs at some point!
